What we want to know is, what is the most expensive state/region of the country to attend college? In this data, we can extract generalizations about the quality of colleges in the region (more expensive ~> higher quality facilities, faculty), and about the economic situation of the area (more expensive ~> better/worse fiscally, or far more people in the area). What we expect, is the North East, and California, to be the most expensive, due to concentration of higher tier schools, such as Harvard, MIT, and CalTech. We expect the Pacific Island region, and midwest, area to be the least expensive.




From this data, we can see that, on average, DC, South Dakota, and Wisconsin are the most expensive states, while Mississippi, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico are the least expensive. This does not support our hypothesis. This is interesting because this tells us that the District of Colombia, while small, has presumably the highest quality colleges/high density of affluent people. This indicates that DC might be considered a destination college location, supported by the fact that it is this nations capital. Conversely, this is interesting because Puerto Rico is the least expensive, perhaps hinging on the quality they provide/demographic they service.
